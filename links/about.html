        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome! I'm Pebbles — a film lover, tea enthusiast, and passionate storyteller.
            This blog is my cozy little corner of the internet where I combine my favorite comforts:
            cinema, a good brew, and meaningful moments.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Whether you're here for thoughtful film reviews, tea recommendations that soothe the soul,
            or to explore the delightful worlds of sweets, books, and events curated by my dear friends
            Juanita, Lindsay, and Hippo — there's something for everyone.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            <em>Films and Teas</em> is more than just a blog; it's an invitation to slow down, sip
            something warm, and enjoy stories that stay with you.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Thanks for stopping by — I’m so glad you’re here.
